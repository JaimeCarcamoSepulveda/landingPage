ODIN PROJECT LANDING PAGE as prototype and building upon that as my basis. 

Project status: Beginning today 6.10.22 

GOALS: 
by commencing this page my goal is to apply all my current knowledge in front end to develop a simple informative page on the topic of Gift of Equity. Once completed it should allow its visitors to have most their questions answered. In addition I hope to apply my novice JS experience to include a few simple tax calculations in order to better present the advantages of such a transaction type. Its calculations will be over month-to-month, year, five years, ten years, thirty years.
